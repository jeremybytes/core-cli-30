# Get Comfortable with .NET Core and the CLI

.NET Core is the future of .NET. So let's get comfortable with the creating, running, and testing applications using the command-line interface. We'll create a self-hosted web service and then write an application to use that service. Unit tests will make sure things work along the way. Whether you're new to .NET Core or have been using .NET Core with Visual Studio, this session will help you get up-to-speed in this powerful environment.

## Demo
Be sure to take a look at the **DemoWalkthrough** file. This walks through the process of starting with an empty folder and creating all of the projects in the repo.
